# Analysis Summary

## Key Question
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

## Overview
The analysis was conducted using 12 months of Cyclistic trip data (January 2023 – December 2023). After cleaning and merging the dataset, we explored user behavior across ride duration, time of day, day of week, month, and bike type.

## Findings

- Members’ rides were more consistent and shorter, suggesting a focus on commuting or short-distance travel.

### 2. Day of Week Usage
- Casual riders peaked on **weekends (Saturday & Sunday)**.
- Members had consistent usage during **weekdays (Monday–Friday)**, aligning with typical commuting behavior.

### 3. Hourly Patterns
- Members showed two peaks: **morning (7–9 AM)** and **evening (4–6 PM)**, indicating work commute usage.
- Casual riders peaked in the **afternoon (12–5 PM)**, associated with leisure and tourism.

### 4. Monthly Trends

- Casual riders showed a larger seasonal spike, with a sharp drop during winter.

### 5. Bike Type Preference

Understanding these differences is crucial for designing targeted marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.
